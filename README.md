# Description
This JavaScript todo list project allows users to create and manage multiple custom named projects, each containing a list of customizable todo tasks with titles, descriptions, and due dates. The projects are saved in storage memory, and can be accessed at any time. The user can mark tasks as complete, remove projects and tasks, and edit task information such as the title, description, or due date. Additionally, the user can view all tasks or filter to see only tasks with a due date of today.
